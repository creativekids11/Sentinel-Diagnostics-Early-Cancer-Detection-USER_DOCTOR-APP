# Payment System Fixes and Email Receipt Feature

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Payment Verification Error
**Problem:** When patients clicked "I've completed the payment", they received the error:
```
Error: Error processing payment confirmation. Please try again
```

**Root Cause:** The `verify_payment` function had an undefined variable `user['id']` on line 4260.

**Fix:** Changed `user['id']` to `session['user_id']` in the logging statement.

### 2. Report ID Undefined Error
**Problem:** The `api_save_report` function referenced an undefined `report_id` variable.

**Fix:** Added `report_id = cursor.lastrowid` after the INSERT statement to capture the generated report ID.

## New Feature: Email Receipt Option

### 1. Database Changes
- Added `email_receipt` column to `pending_payments` table
- Default value is `TRUE` (users get emails by default)
- Added migration code to update existing tables

### 2. Frontend Changes (UPI Payment Page)
- Added checkbox option: "Send email receipt when payment is approved"
- Checkbox is checked by default
- Updated JavaScript to include email preference in payment submission
- Added responsive CSS styling for the checkbox

### 3. Backend Changes
- Updated `verify_payment()` function to store email receipt preference
- Modified `admin_approve_payment()` function to check email preference
- Only sends confirmation email if user requested it
- Enhanced `send_subscription_confirmation_email()` function with proper email template

### 4. Admin Panel Updates
- Admin payment verification page now shows whether user requested email receipt
- Visual indicators: ‚úâÔ∏è "Requested" (green) or üö´ "Not requested" (gray)
- Admins can see user's email preference before approving payments

## How It Works

### Patient Flow:
1. Patient selects a plan (Pro/Premium)
2. Goes to UPI payment page
3. Can check/uncheck "Send email receipt when payment is approved"
4. Completes payment and submits verification with preference
5. Receives confirmation that payment is submitted for verification

### Admin Flow:
1. Admin sees pending payment in admin panel
2. Can see if user requested email receipt
3. Approves payment with admin notes
4. System automatically sends email ONLY if user requested it
5. Activates user's subscription plan

### Email Content:
- Professional subscription confirmation email
- Includes plan details, expiration date, and welcome message
- Only sent when both conditions are met:
  - Admin approves the payment
  - User requested email receipt during payment submission

## Files Modified:
- `app.py` - Fixed errors and added email logic
- `templates/patient/upi_payment.html` - Added checkbox and styling
- `templates/admin/payments.html` - Added email receipt indicator
- Database schema updated with `email_receipt` column
