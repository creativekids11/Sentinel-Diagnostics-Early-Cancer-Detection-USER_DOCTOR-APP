- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Loads comprehensive platform documentation
- **Role-Aware Responses**: Different assistance for patients vs doctors  
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across chat sessions
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and error recovery

**Key Features:**
```python
# Smart role detection
response = assistant.get_response(
    user_message="How do I book an appointment?",
    user_role="patient",  # Auto-detects context
    conversation_history=[...]  # Maintains context
)

# Quick suggestions
suggestions = assistant.get_quick_suggestions("patient")
# Returns: ["How do I book an appointment?", "How to take risk assessment?", ...]
```

### 2. API Routes (`routes.py`)
- **POST `/api/sage/chat`**: Main conversation endpoint
- **GET `/api/sage/suggestions`**: Context-aware quick suggestions
- **POST `/api/sage/search`**: Knowledge base search
- **GET `/api/sage/health`**: System health monitoring

**Request/Response Example:**
```javascript
// Send message
const response = await fetch('/api/sage/chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        message: "How do I book an appointment?",
        user_role: "patient"
    })
});

// Get response
const data = await response.json();
// { success: true, response: "To book an appointment...", timestamp: "..." }
```

### 3. Chat Interface (`chat_widget.html`)
- **Modern Design**: Dracula theme integration with healthcare styling
- **Real-time Chat**: WebSocket-like experience with instant responses
- **Message Types**: User, AI, system, error, and success messages
